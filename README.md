📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to build an interactive frontend application that:

Consumes a public REST API

Manages game state on the client side

Demonstrates strong understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and browser behavior

🧩 Features

Two-player gameplay with name input

Category selection for each round

Questions fetched dynamically from an external Trivia API

Multiple-choice questions with instant score updates

Round-based flow and final winner declaration

Responsive and clean UI

Fully client-side implementation (no frameworks, no localStorage)

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Layout and responsive styling

JavaScript (ES6+) – Game logic and state management

DOM APIs – Dynamic UI updates and interactions

REST API – Fetching trivia questions in real time

Netlify – Deployment with GitHub integration

🌐 API Used

The Trivia API
https://the-trivia-api.com/docs/

The application fetches questions based on selected categories and processes the response using JSON parsing and error handling.

🧠 How the Game Works (User Flow)

Players enter their names on the start screen

Each round begins with category selection

Questions are fetched from the API for the chosen category

Players answer questions one by one

Scores are updated dynamically

After all rounds, the final winner (or draw) is displayed

Users can restart the game and return to the main screen
